                    <p>
                      We have created the Worldwide Non-pharmaceutical Interventions for COVID-19 (WNTRAC), a comprehensive dataset of non-pharmaceutical interventions that represents the non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop the transmission of COVID-19 implemented by governments across 359 geographical regions (countries, dependent territories & special areas of geographical interest) in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Example non-pharmaceutical interventions include social distancing, travel bans/restrictions, school closing and the introduction of actions to manage the economic impact caused by the COIVD-19 pandemic. However these non-pharmaceutical interventions vary significantly on when and how they have been implemented and decision makers at all levels are working diligently to determine the best time to lift the restrictions while minimizing any negative impact made towards controlling the disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Worldwide Non-pharmaceutical Interventions Tracker for COVID-19 dataset has been compiled by using wikipedia articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic and additionally referencing to news articles and government executive orders (for U.S states) when available. There are a total of 15 non-pharmaceutical interventions types recorded and we have created a taxonomy to assign a numerical measure to these non-pharmaceutical interventions
