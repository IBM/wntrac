Against an emerging, highly transmissible disease with no definitive treatment or vaccine, governments worldwide have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of the virus. Examples of such interventions include community actions (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings), individual actions (e.g. mask wearing, self-quarantine), and environmental actions (e.g. public facility cleaning).\n\nWe, at <a href=\"https://www.draco.res.ibm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Research</a>, present the Worldwide Non-pharmaceutical Interventions Tracker for COVID-19 (WNTRAC), a comprehensive dataset consisting of over 7,000 NPIs implemented worldwide since the start of the pandemic. WNTRAC covers NPIs implemented across 261 countries and territories, and classifies NPI events into a taxonomy of 16 NPI categories.
